            | The secret to making sure daily appreciation happens is not that complicated.
            | You just need a <em>system</em>. Not any old system will do. It needs to be fun,
            | and the tokens of appreciation have to be memorable, so that it doesn't take a
            | lot of time to figure out what you want to say. In fact, with most props, just
            | a word or two of description will suffice.
