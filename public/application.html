It turned out that even when you have a great company culture, it's hard to keep employees happy and motivated unless you make them feel appreciated every day.</p><p>But how do you get yourself and your people to remember to give thanks to each other every day? Turns out the secret is not that complicated. You just need a <em>system</em>. But not any old system will do. It needs to be fun, and the tokens of appreciation have to be memorable, so that it doesn't take a lot of time to figure out what you want to say. In fact, with most props, just a word or two of description will suffice.x</p></div></div></intro><material-toolbar ng-show="_.any(Props.feed)" class="material-theme-light"><div class="material-toolbar-tools">My Feed</div></material-toolbar><prop-card ng-repeat="card in Props.feed" ng-animate="'animate'"></prop-card></material-content></main><footer ng-if="currentUser">Copyright &copy; 2010-2014 DueProps.com
